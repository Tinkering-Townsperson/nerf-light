# Nerf Light

Red light green light game with CV Nerf turret.


**What this is**

So you've watched Squid Game before, right?....

If not, that's okay. "Red light green light" is a game where one person decides whether it's "green light" or "red light". When it's green light, the deciding person must not look at the players, while the players travel towards the deciding person. When the deciding person announces "red light", all players must halt any movement immediately. The deciding person must turn around quickly, seeing if anyone moved. Should someone move during this phase, they will be eliminated.

The TV show "Squid Game" introduces a verry deadly twist to this game: people now get shot to death if they fail in the game. This is exactly what we're trying to create. 

The camera tracks people and detects movements, the RPI generates an angle for a stepper motor to turn towards, and the stepper motor turns the gun. When the gun's in position, a beefy servo motor attached to the trigger will fire the (Nerf) gun (and kill the person :-[)

**Why we built this**

We built this for Highway, so we decided to build something very cool, something that people will like. With the recent Squid Game 3 releasing, I'm certain that this little invention will become very popular...
